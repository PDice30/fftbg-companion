# FFTBG Companion

FFTBG Companion is a Twitch Extension Overlay for twitch.tv/fftbattleground. 

From the channels' about page: FFTBattleground is an automated stream of continual Final Fantasy Tactics battles, pitting squads of four AI-controlled units against each other in single-elimination tournaments featuring eight teams: Red, Blue, Green, Yellow, White, Black, Purple and Brown. The winner of each tournament earns the right to challenge the current Champion team to seize that position for themselves!

## FFTBG Companion offers viewers:
* Real-time data about the current 8 fighters.
* A light-weight, clean, and responsive UI.
* An alternative to text responses from chat commands.
* Many more features and fun animations coming soon.

## FFTBG Companion would not be possible without:
* **TheKillerNacho**: Operator of the FFTBattleground Twitch channel.
* **SirBraneDamuj**: Creator of mustad.io and allowing me the use of their AWS S3 asset hosting.  Also general inspiration from mustad.io (Great site, check it out!).
